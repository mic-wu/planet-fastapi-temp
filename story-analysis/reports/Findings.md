# Findings

things to watch out for when working with stories:

1. story frames are in a user specified order, and may not be chronological.
  - example: https://www.planet.com/stories/bougainville-reef-KjlJEuRDg
  - (this is not a rare occurrence)

2. we only have access to stories marked as public.
  - example non-public story: AP news whitehouse.
  - accessible, but unlisted
